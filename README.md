## Motivation To Create Stonks

I have always wanted to learn stock trading, but being a college student with limited funds has made it difficult to pursue. That's why I decided to create Stonks, a real-time trading simulator, which allows users to practice trading without risking any real money. Stonks aims to provide a platform for users to learn about the stock market and investing in a safe and controlled environment.

Stonks also features a positive community with robust SPAM and abuse detection with the help of MindsDb where users can interact with each other, ask questions, and learn more about trading from experienced members.

Trading can be intimidating for beginners, which is why I have implemented an AI assistant named Billy with the help of MindsDb and OpenAI, which can help users learn more about each stock and answer any questions they may have. This AI assistant will save the user time searching for answers to their questions while also allowing them to learn more about the company in which they want to invest.
